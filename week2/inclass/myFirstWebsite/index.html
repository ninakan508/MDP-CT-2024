            <p class="p-sans p-lead">The Munchkin is a breed of cat characterized by its very short legs, which are
                caused
                by genetic mutation. Compared to many other cat breeds, it is a relatively new breed, documented since
                1940s[1] and officially
                recognized in 1991.[2] The Munchkin is considered to be the original breed of dwarf cat.

            <p>Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by The International Cat Association
                (TICA) in
                1997 with critics voicing concerns over potential health and mobility issues.[3] Many pedigree cat
                associations
                around the world have refused to recognize the Munchkin cat due to the welfare of the breed and
                uncertainty
                of
                the health issues,[4] including the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF).[5] Breeding of Munchkin
                cats
                is
                prohibited by law in several countries due to these genetic health concerns.
