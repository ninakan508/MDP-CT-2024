    <h1>Future Ecological Drone</h1>

    <p class="description">
        In an ecology-driven future, preserving the natural balance becomes a priority for both individuals and societies. This spherical autonomous drone is designed to monitor plant health, detect early signs of wildfires, and observe animal activity in remote ecosystems. Compact and energy-efficient, it enables continuous environmental surveillance without causing disruption to the habitats it protects.
    </p>

    <h2>Selecting the Future Scenario</h2>
    <p class="description">
        As part of the "Archeology of the Futures" assignment, I first explored four possible future scenarios based on two axes: Individual Freedom vs. Social Responsibility, and Ecology Driven vs. Technology Driven.

    <p class="description">
        After considering the potential roles of technology and society, I chose the "Ecology Driven" quadrant. This direction focuses on sustaining environmental balance through collective action and responsible resource management, aligning with the purpose of my autonomous ecological monitoring drone.
    </p>

    <h2>Ecology Driven</h2>
    <p class="description">
        This drone is designed for an ecology-driven future where environmental protection is a primary goal. By enabling continuous, non-invasive monitoring of natural areas, it helps maintain biodiversity and ensures early detection of ecological threats.
    </p>

    <h2>Design Concept</h2>
    <p class="description">
        The spherical design minimizes air resistance and allows smooth movement across diverse terrains. The central optical module is equipped with high-precision sensors for real-time environmental data collection. Its modular surface components adapt to various climates, ensuring the droneâ€™s long-term durability in different ecological conditions. Lightweight composite materials further enhance its flight efficiency and endurance.
