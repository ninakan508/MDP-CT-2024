    <h1>Dream Space: Maze</h1>

    <p class="description">
        For this project, I created a dream space centered around a <strong>maze</strong>. Inspired by the movie <em>The Maze Runner</em> and my recurring dreams of being trapped inside mazes, I wanted to design an environment full of mystery, gentle confusion, and playful exploration.
    </p>

    <h2>Planning & Building</h2>

    <p class="description">
        I started by sketching a 20x20 orthogonal maze, carefully arranging the pathways to create a balanced and navigable structure.
    </p>

    <div class="gallery">
        <div class="image-block">

            <p class="image-description">Original maze sketch layout.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="description">
        Instead of manually drawing every wall in Unity, I designed a custom terrain brush based on the maze layout. This allowed me to stamp the entire maze onto the terrain surface efficiently.
    </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="description">
        To create a more lively and natural feeling, I manually painted grass across the maze floor. Although it was time-consuming, this process gave the terrain a rich, layered texture.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p class="description">
        I then constructed the maze entrance, adding small structures and natural decorations to guide the players' first impression.

    <h2>Final Showcase</h2>

    <p class="description">
        Here is a final walkthrough video of the completed maze environment, highlighting the atmosphere, navigation experience, and visual storytelling of the space.

    <h2>Challenges & Adaptations</h2>

    <p class="description">
        One major challenge was texturing the maze walls. Initially, I tried applying a detailed soil texture, but it stretched and distorted badly over the vertical surfaces, ruining the visual consistency. To fix this, I replaced complex textures with a simple brown material and strategically planted trees to mask the terrain edges, creating a softer, more immersive environment.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        This experience taught me that sometimes adapting the strategy — focusing less on textures and more on environmental storytelling — can lead to better results.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience & Reflection</h2>

    <p class="description">
        To make the maze explorable, I added a mini First Person Controller in Unity. No complex physics systems were necessary beyond the default collision and gravity provided by Unity. Moving through the maze from a first-person perspective enhanced the sense of immersion and scale.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        The biggest takeaway from this project was learning to adapt my original vision based on technical limitations. In the future, I would love to develop a dynamic maze where paths could shift and change as players explore — creating a truly living, breathing dream space.
